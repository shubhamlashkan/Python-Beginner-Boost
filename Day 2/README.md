# Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Every variable has a name and a value, and the value can be of different data types. Understanding variables and data types is essential as they form the foundation of any programming language. Let's explore variables and data types in Python!

# Creating variables
To create a variable in Python, you need to assign a value to it using the "=" operator. Here's an example:

    name = "John"
    age = 25

In this example, we created two variables: "name" with the value "John" (a string) and "age" with the value 25 (an integer).

# Numeric data types

Python supports various numeric data types, including:

* Integers (int): Whole numbers without decimal points. Example: age = 25
* Floating-point numbers (float): Numbers with decimal points. Example: pi = 3.14
Text data type
* Textual data in Python is represented using strings. Strings are enclosed in either single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). Here's an example:

    message = "Hello, Python!"

You can perform various operations on strings, such as concatenation and slicing.

* Boolean data type

The Boolean data type has two possible values: True and False. Booleans are used for logical operations and control flow statements. Example:

    is_python_fun = True
    is_learning = False

# Type conversion

Python provides functions to convert variables from one data type to another. These functions include:

int(): Converts a value to an integer.
float(): Converts a value to a floating-point number.
str(): Converts a value to a string.
Here's an example of type conversion:


    age = 25
    age_str = str(age)  # Converts the integer to a string

It's important to note that Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Python infers the data type based on the value assigned to the variable.

Understanding variables and data types is crucial as they allow you to work with different kinds of data in your programs. In the next video, we will explore operators and expressions in Python, which enable you to perform operations on variables and values.
